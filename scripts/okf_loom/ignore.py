r"""Gitignore-style exclusion for bundle markdown scanning (current spec §5).

Why this exists: ``Bundle.load`` used to be a raw ``rglob("*.md")`` over the
bundle root. Serving or validating a real workspace root swept
``node_modules``, nested cloned repos, virtualenvs and ``.okf-loom`` session
state into the bundle — thousands of vendor ``.md`` files surfacing as
missing-``type`` errors, and forcing docs to physically move into a clean
subdirectory just to get a usable bundle root.

This module is the single scanning path. It walks the tree top-down and
PRUNES excluded directories (never descending into them — a ``node_modules``
holding 30k files costs nothing), applying three exclusion rule groups where
a match in a later group overrides the earlier ones:

1. Built-in defaults (:data:`DEFAULT_EXCLUDES`): hidden directories
   (``.git``, ``.okf-loom``, ``.venv``, …), ``node_modules``,
   ``__pycache__``, ``venv``, ``bower_components``. Plus one structural
   rule that is NOT pattern-based: any non-root directory containing a
   ``.git`` entry (a nested cloned repo, submodule, or worktree) is pruned.
2. ``.gitignore`` rules — the bundle root's file AND nested ones, each
   scoped to its own directory — when ``respect_gitignore`` is on (the
   default). This also makes the self-ignoring ``.okf-loom`` state dirs
   (each holds a ``.gitignore`` containing ``*``) invisible wherever a
   custom ``studio.session_dir`` puts them.
3. ``bundle.exclude`` patterns from ``okf-loom.config.yaml`` (a negation
   here, e.g. ``"!.docs/"``, can re-include something the defaults or a
   ``.gitignore`` excluded — with git's own limitation that a path under a
   PRUNED directory cannot come back this way).

Above all of that sit ``bundle.include`` patterns — the explicit add-back
lever. Include beats every exclusion source, including the structural
nested-repo rule, and CAN reach inside pruned directories. Two forms:

* **Directory form** (``"vendor-repo/"`` or a wildcard-free path like
  ``"node_modules/my-pkg/docs"``): the directory is *revived* — the scanner
  descends its ancestors just far enough to reach it, then scans the
  subtree as normal bundle content. Exclusion rules that were overridden AT
  the revived directory (an ancestor-level ``node_modules/**`` in a
  ``.gitignore``, a ``bundle.exclude`` that killed it) stay overridden for
  its contents, while unrelated rules — the hidden-dir default, basename
  rules like ``*.tmp.md``, excludes targeting deeper paths — keep applying
  inside. This is the recommended form.
* **Glob form** (``"vendor-repo/**"``): force-includes exactly what it
  matches, everything beneath — defaults included. The scanner traverses
  whatever the glob covers, so a broad ``**`` on a huge tree is a
  deliberate, paid-for choice.

Include patterns without a ``/`` (basename form, e.g. ``"keep.md"``) apply
wherever the scan already reaches but do NOT open up pruned directories —
pulling something out of a pruned tree requires naming its path. This keeps
an innocuous one-word include from turning every watcher tick into a full
``.git``/``node_modules`` walk.

Pattern dialect: the practical gitignore subset — ``*`` / ``?`` / character
classes (none of which cross ``/``), ``**`` path-segment wildcards, trailing
``/`` = directory-only, a ``/`` anywhere else = anchored to the rule's base
directory, leading ``!`` = negation (exclude groups only), ``\`` escapes,
``#`` comments. Within an exclusion group the LAST matching rule wins (git
semantics).

Zero dependencies (stdlib only) per the §3 hard invariant, and a leaf
module: nothing here imports other ``okf_loom`` modules.
