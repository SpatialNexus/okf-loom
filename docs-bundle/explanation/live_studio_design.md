# Why the live studio exists

This essay explains the reasoning behind the live collaborative studio.
It is not the tutorial for using the studio — that is
[Use the live studio](/tutorials/live_studio_basics.md) and
[Direct the agent loop](/tutorials/author_with_agent.md) — and it is
not the neutral reference for its routes and state model — that is
[HTTP server routes](/reference/http_routes.md) and
[Comment lifecycle and archive rules](/reference/comment_lifecycle.md).
It is the *why* behind those surfaces.

The binding design document is the
[`current okf-loom spec`](/reference/spec.md); this essay
summarises its live-studio posture (§10) and decisions at a readable
length and links out for depth.

# The posture the studio is built on

The studio rests on a single founding claim, stated as decision **D8**
and design posture §1.1 of the spec:

> **The agent is the author and the manager of the OKF files. Writing
> OKF files *is* the agent's job.** Its mechanical *and* semantic edits
> apply directly through the mutators; they appear live and land in the
> change list with one-click undo. The user's safety net is
> **transparency plus undo**, not an approval step.

Everything else in the studio follows from that. If the agent is the
author, then the user does not need an editor — they need a *directing*
surface. If the agent edits freely, then the safety net has to be
*see-and-undo*, not *review-before-write*. If the user is the sole
admin, then nothing should gate them, and the only protections that
remain are the ones that defend against things that are *not* the user.

# Why comment-driven directing

The studio's primary user interaction is a **comment** — a short
directive the user attaches to a concept, a section, a text selection,
or a frontmatter key. The user does not hand-edit markdown in the
browser; they point and comment, and the agent authors the files.

| The alternative considered | Why the studio chose comments instead |
|---|---|
| A direct in-browser markdown editor | Introduces a user↔agent merge problem (concurrent edits to the same file), requires CRDT/OT, and still needs a separate channel to *tell* the agent what to do. The agent is the sole writer of `.md` files, so there is no merge problem to solve day-to-day. |
| A chat sidebar that dispatches commands | Collapses "where is this about" into "what is this about". A comment anchored to a schema row carries both: it names the target *and* the intent. |
| A queue of typed actions (button per verb) | Forecloses the open-ended asks ("rewrite this section from the spec", "extract these columns into their own concepts") that are the actual daily work. Free-text comments with an anchor cover all of them. |

A comment is the steering wheel; the change list plus undo (§12.2 /
§12.5 of the spec) is the review surface. The user reads in Rendered /
Source / Split — all read-only — and directs; the agent claims a
comment, does its scoped work, writes via the ordinary mutators, and
resolves it, linking the activity entries it produced. The canonical
loop is documented in
[Direct the agent loop](/tutorials/author_with_agent.md).

> The user can still edit files directly on disk in their own editor —
> that is their machine, and the watcher picks it up. The studio web UI
> is a *directing* surface, not a direct editor.

# Why there is no review gate by default

This is the most often-questioned choice, so it is worth being precise.

A review gate is the idea that the agent proposes edits and a human
approves each one before it lands. The studio ships *without* one, and
the reasoning is that a review gate optimises for the wrong failure
mode. The daily failure mode of an agent authoring a knowledge bundle is
not "the agent wrote something malicious and we stopped it" — the agent
is the user's own, running locally, on the user's own files. The daily
failure mode is "the agent wrote the wrong *good* edit, and the user
wants to revert it in one click."

That argues for a fast, visible **undo**, not a slow, gating **approve**.
So the studio invests in three things instead of a gate:

1. **A live change list** — a read-only timeline of everything that
   happened, with actor, action, affected concepts, and a timestamp.
2. **Per-write undo snapshots** — prior bytes captured before every
   agent write under `.okf-loom/session/history/`.
3. **Group undo** — a single agent pass that writes several files is
   recorded as one group (a shared `group_id`), so the user reverts the
   whole pass with one click, not file-by-file.

A user who genuinely *wants* to restrain their own agent — propose-only
mode, forbidden paths, per-action caps — can opt in via
`studio.constraints` (spec §12.3). The studio ships the *seam* (the
`/__apply` endpoint and the `proposals.jsonl` contract) but never the
*policy*. That keeps the default experience frictionless and lets a
user build whatever restraint they want as their own module.

# Why everything is on by default

`scripts/okf-loom serve <bundle>` — with no flags — opens the full studio: live SSE
updates, source and split views, commenting, directing, agent presence,
the change list, and undo. There is no `--edit` to unlock, no per-save
consent, and no permission prompt.

The reasoning is that the studio's value is *collaboration that feels
alive*, and collaboration you have to assemble out of flags is
collaboration that does not happen. Every default that is off by
default is a feature the user has to discover, and the studio's P0 bar
(spec §1.7) is judged on how alive it feels out of the box, not on how
many features it has behind toggles.

The defaults that remain are the ones that cost the user *zero friction*
and defend against things that are not the user (see the trust model
below). Editing, saving, and watching are never behind a gate; only
the loopback boundary, the cross-origin guard, and the active-code gate
are — and the first two are invisible to a local user.

# Why first paint is treated as a contract

The studio does not wait for its deferred modules and then repair a visibly
wrong page. The server places the inert studio configuration first in the
document head, and the shared theme resolver runs during head parsing. It can
therefore combine configuration, saved Appearance preferences, and the OS
light/dark setting before the body paints. The desktop rail reserve is likewise
part of initial CSS geometry, not padding animated in after boot. This is why a
dark destination and the concept centerline remain stable when you follow an
ordinary link.

Boot status follows the same principle. The JavaScript failure banner is hidden
unless boot genuinely settles unavailable. A successful synchronous boot marks
itself ready only after its setup completes, so there is no successful-boot
fallback flash. A blocked module, an evaluation failure, or a throw during boot
settles unavailable and reveals one stable banner. Late fetches and timers cannot
turn that failure into success, or turn a settled success into failure. With
JavaScript disabled, the separate `<noscript>` notice explains the read-only
state instead.

# Why navigation remains native

The studio patches a concept in place when the underlying file changes, but it
does not capture ordinary document links to simulate an SPA. Internal concepts
remain real anchors: browser Back and Forward retain their document-history
meaning, Enter activates a focused link, and Ctrl/Cmd-click opens a new tab.
Keeping these platform behaviors is more valuable than hiding a page load, and
the prepaint theme and geometry contracts make the native destination load
stable.

# Why rails and tables have fallback-first geometry

On a JavaScript-enabled desktop concept page, space for the studio rail exists
from first layout, so mounting the rail does not recenter the article. Mobile
does not reserve that space, and a no-JS desktop does not leave a dead gutter for
a rail that cannot mount.

Wide tables follow the same fallback-first rule. Server-rendered tables are
semantic, locally horizontally scrollable, keyboard focusable, and named with a
scroll instruction before any enhancer runs. JavaScript improves only the
affordance: an overflowing table gets a labelled focusable wrapper, edge cues,
and a visible scroll hint; a table that fits remains a plain table without an
extra tab stop. Resize and live patches recalculate that distinction. If
JavaScript is unavailable, every column is still reachable and the page itself
does not become horizontally scrollable.

# Why Server-Sent Events, with a polling fallback

Live push is Server-Sent Events (SSE) over plain HTTP, served from the
stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`. The spec records this as decision **D0**:
SSE plus REST, not WebSocket.

| The alternative considered | Why SSE won |
|---|---|
| **WebSocket** | Richer bidirectional channel, but the studio's traffic is asymmetric (server pushes change/presence/comment events; client sends occasional POSTs). WebSocket would add a dependency surface and a protocol layer for a need SSE already meets with one worker thread per stream under stdlib. |
| **Pure polling** | Simpler, but a polling interval short enough to feel live burns cycles doing nothing, and an interval long enough to be cheap feels sluggish. SSE pushes the moment a change lands. |

The one real-world failure of raw SSE is that some intermediaries —
Cloudflare quick tunnels, corporate proxies, certain CDNs — buffer the
`text/event-stream` response, so `EventSource` connects but never
receives frames. The studio handles this with a **starvation
watchdog**: if no SSE frame arrives within a grace window (~5s), the
client arms a polling fallback that fetches `/__data/events?since=…`
on a short interval and dispatches through the *same* handler path as
SSE. If SSE recovers, the poller stops. The no-refresh contract
therefore survives behind a proxy that would silently starve SSE
alone (spec §7.3).

This matters because the no-refresh contract is a P0 requirement, not
polish: a full-page reload after every agent edit would discard the
user's scroll position, selection, view mode, and open comment threads.
The studio patches the smallest affected region and preserves all of
that state (spec §7.3).

# Why archive is a separate track

A comment carries two independent pieces of state:

| Track | Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lifecycle | `state` | `open` / `claimed` / `resolved` / `dismissed` | Where the work is. |
| Visibility | `archived` | `true` / `false` | Whether the panel soft-hides the thread. |

Archiving a resolved comment keeps it resolved; unarchiving restores
the prior visibility without flipping `state`. Compatibility records with
`state == "archived"` are normalised on read to `archived=true,
state="open"` so old sessions migrate automatically.

The archive track also carries three server-side rules that make it
behave predictably:

- **Archive is root-only.** Replies cannot be archived independently;
  the whole thread archives together.
- **Archive is gated on whole-thread-resolved.** The server returns
  `409` with the unresolved ids if any comment in the thread is not yet
  `resolved`, so the user cannot accidentally hide unfinished work.
- **Replying to an archived thread auto-unarchives the parent.** Adding
  to a thread reopens it for business; archive is a soft hide, not a
  closed state.

The full state model is in
[Comment lifecycle and archive rules](/reference/comment_lifecycle.md);
the step-by-step recipe is in
[Archive and resolve comment threads](/how-to/archive_threads.md).

# The trust model: gate the port and the code, not the person

The studio is single-user local-admin. There is exactly one human, and
they own everything — the bundle *and* the agent that works for them.
The studio **never gates, prompts, or flag-guards the user**. What it
keeps are the protections that defend against things that are *not* the
user, and the spec is explicit (§15) that these must cost the user zero
friction.

| Protection | What it stops | What it does NOT stop |
|---|---|---|
| **Loopback by default** (`127.0.0.1`) | Other machines reaching the studio. Exposing the port is an explicit `--public` plus an acknowledgement. | The user or their agent. |
| **Per-session CSRF token** (`X-OKF-Token`, written `0600`) | A random web page POSTing to the localhost studio behind the user's back. | The studio's own page, which carries the token automatically. |
| **Origin AND Host allow-list** | Cross-site and DNS-rebinding attacks (checking both closes a hole that forging only `Origin` could exploit). | The user's own requests from an allowed host. |
| **Two-layer active-code gate** | A *downloaded bundle* trying to run code (JS / full-HTML overrides / viewer plugins) in the user's browser. | Editing, saving, and watching — those are explicitly not behind this gate. |

The summary the spec arrives at — and that this essay will end on — is:

> **We gate the port and the bundle's code, never the user or their
> agent.** The user's safety net for agent-authored edits is the live
> change list plus (group) undo, not an approval step.

Data-safety invariants (validate-before-write, path containment, atomic
writes, optimistic per-doc `rev`) are kept too, but they are framed as
*correctness* guards, not *permission* guards: they stop corruption and
lost work, not access. The single collision case the studio has to
handle — the user editing a file directly on disk at the same moment
the agent writes it — surfaces non-destructively as a `409` with a
diff, never as a silent clobber (spec §9.3 / §9.4).

# Why the server stays LLM-free

A final choice worth naming is that **the server never runs the agent.**
The server emits events, runs mechanical operations (index regen,
relation mirroring), and serves the studio; all semantic work is done
by the external agent (opencode / Claude Code / Codex / a custom
harness), which watches the change feed, reacts to comments, reasons,
and writes back through the ordinary mutators.

The reasons are the current non-goals: the checkout runtime stays
harness-agnostic (no opinion on which agent framework consumes it),
keeps the primary runtime dependency-light (no model bundled, no GPU assumed, no
network required), and keeps the collaboration working headlessly
(`scripts/okf-loom watch` tails the same change feed with no browser at all). The
agent loop — `scripts/okf-loom wait` blocks in the foreground, the agent claims,
writes via mutators, resolves — is the same shape whether the studio
is open or not. See [Direct the agent loop](/tutorials/author_with_agent.md).
