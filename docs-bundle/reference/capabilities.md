# Capability registry

Capabilities are okf-loom's forward-compatibility mechanism.
SPEC §9 mandates that producers MAY add arbitrary frontmatter keys
and consumers MUST preserve them round-trip; the capability registry
is how okf-loom makes those arbitrary keys **meaningful** without
requiring a spec change.

A capability is a named, versioned declaration of an OPTIONAL
behaviour okf-loom recognises. Bundles opt in by declaring
capabilities under `okf_extensions:` or simply by using the keys
they govern.
See [index.md](/reference/index.md) for the rest of the reference quadrant.

# Tier model

| Tier | Meaning | Activation |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Always active. Format primitives okf-loom could not function without. | Unconditional. |
| `recommended` | Ships with okf-loom; no plugin or extra required. | Activate on declaration or on observed use. |
| `optional` | Recognised but may need an external provider, plugin, or explicit opt-in. | Activate on declaration or on observed use of governed keys. |

A capability is "active" for a bundle when at least one of these holds:

1. It is `core` tier.
2. It is declared under `okf_extensions:` in the bundle-root
   `index.md` frontmatter.
3. Any of its `frontmatter_keys` appear in any concept's frontmatter
   (auto-activation).
4. Any of its `body_sections` appear as a heading in any concept
   (auto-activation).

Unknown declarations (an id not in the registry) are surfaced as
`undeclared` for diagnostics, not errors.

# Catalogue

## Core (always active)

| Id | Governs | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `okf.cap.frontmatter` | `type`, `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, `timestamp` | Parse YAML frontmatter; alias-collapse known key variants. |
| `okf.cap.links` | — | Resolve absolute (§5.1) and relative (§5.2) cross-links. |
| `okf.cap.index_md` | — | Synthesize and respect SPEC §6 `index.md` directory listings. |
| `okf.cap.log_md` | — | Append to SPEC §7 `log.md` update history. |
| `okf.cap.listings` | — | Auto-generate folder/tag listing pages in the viewer. |
| `okf.cap.search_lexical` | — | Zero-dependency lexical search (BM25 / TF-IDF). |
| `okf.cap.graph` | — | Force-directed graph view of concept cross-links. |
| `okf.cap.backlinks` | — | Reverse-link (cited-by) panels in the viewer. |
| `okf.cap.discovery_mentions` | — | Detect unlinked mentions of concept titles as discovery suggestions. |

## Recommended (ship with okf-loom; opt-in by declaration or use)

| Id | Governs | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `okf.cap.search_hybrid` | — | Hybrid lexical + SemanticLite search with reciprocal rank fusion (RRF). Activated on a successful hybrid query (at least one match). |
| `okf.cap.popovers` | — | Hover-preview popovers for cross-concept links in the viewer. |
| `okf.cap.log_timeline` | — | Render SPEC §7 log entries as a navigable timeline view. |
| `okf.cap.tag_pages` | — | Synthesize per-tag listing pages and tag cloud. |

## Optional (require an extra or plugin, or activate on use)

| Id | Governs | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `okf.cap.typed_relations` | `relations` | Interpret `relations:` as a list of typed relation objects (`{target, type, detail, …}`). |
| `okf.cap.entities` | `entities` | Interpret `entities:` as named-entity tags. Entries may be bare strings or `{id, label, kind, aliases}`. Labels + aliases feed entity search. |
| `okf.cap.aliases` | `aliases` | Interpret top-level `aliases:` as alternate names for the concept. Consumed by entity search and the viewer. |
| `okf.cap.provenance` | `provenance` | Interpret `provenance:` as source/origin metadata for the concept. |
| `okf.cap.citations` | `citations` | Interpret `citations:` as reference citations. |
| `okf.cap.embeddings` | — | Emit per-concept dense-vector embeddings for semantic search. |
| `okf.cap.discovery_ner` | — | Use offline GLiNER NER to suggest entities in concept bodies. |
| `okf.cap.discovery_llm` | — | Use an LLM to suggest missing links, relations, and summaries. |
| `okf.cap.diataxis_types` | — | Recognise the Diátaxis taxonomy (`Tutorial` / `How-to` / `Reference` / `Explanation`) for `type` values. |
| `okf.cap.wikilinks` | body syntax `[[…]]` | Recognise Obsidian-style wikilinks (SPEC §10). Resolved to concept ids and added to the graph as `form="wikilink"` edges. No frontmatter key. |
| `okf.cap.jsonld_export` | — | Export the bundle graph as JSON-LD (schema.org/Dataset where applicable). |
| `okf.cap.multi_bundle` | — | Treat multiple bundles as one federated graph. |

# Opt-in mechanisms

## Frontmatter declaration

Declare under `okf_extensions:` in the bundle-root `index.md`
frontmatter (SPEC §11):

```yaml
---
okf_version: "0.1"
okf_extensions:
  - okf.cap.typed_relations
  - okf.cap.entities
  - okf.cap.aliases
  - acme.custom_taxonomy   # user-defined, registered via plugin
generated: true
---
```

Only the bundle-root `index.md` may carry frontmatter (see
[frontmatter.md § Reserved filename frontmatter](frontmatter.md)).
Non-root `index.md` files are pure listings and cannot declare
extensions.

## Auto-activation

A capability auto-activates the moment any of its governed
`frontmatter_keys` appears in any concept, or any of its
`body_sections` appears as a heading. No declaration is required.

Example: adding `entities:` to a single concept activates
`okf.cap.entities` for the whole bundle; entity search and the
SemanticLite profile (which weights entity labels + aliases) begin
honouring it.

## Special-case activations

| Capability | Special activation |
|---|---|
| `okf.cap.search_hybrid` | Activated on the first hybrid query that produces at least one match (`scripts/okf-loom search … --mode hybrid`). A zero-match query does NOT activate. |
| `okf.cap.wikilinks` | Body syntax only. Activated on the first `[[…]]` use anywhere in the bundle. |

# Resolving capabilities

## CLI

```bash
# Every capability okf-loom knows:
scripts/okf-loom capabilities

# Which are active for this bundle (declared + auto-activated):
scripts/okf-loom capabilities --bundle path/to/bundle
```

Both accept `--format json`.

## Library

```python
from okf_loom.extensions import default_registry
from okf_loom import Bundle

bundle = Bundle.load("path/to/bundle")
resolved = bundle.capabilities()   # ResolvedCapabilities
print(resolved.active_ids)         # set of active capability ids
print(resolved.undeclared)         # list of unknown declared ids

if resolved.is_active("okf.cap.typed_relations"):
    ...  # feature is on for this bundle
```

`ResolvedCapabilities.active_ids` returns the active set;
`is_active(cap_id)` is the per-capability check.

## Validation

| Check | Severity | When it fires |
|---|---|---|
| `capability.undeclared` | WARNING | A declared id is not in the registry. |
| `capability.inactive_use` | INFO | A concept uses a governed key without the capability declared (auto-activated). |

```bash
scripts/okf-loom validate path/to/bundle --checks capability_declarations
```

# Defining a custom capability

```python
from okf_loom.extensions import Capability, default_registry

default_registry().register(Capability(
    id="acme.custom_taxonomy",
    tier="optional",
    description="Recognise Acme's internal concept taxonomy.",
    frontmatter_keys=("acme_kind", "acme_domain"),
    body_sections=("Acceptance Criteria",),
))
```

The id must be namespaced (e.g. `acme.x`); bare names without a dot
are rejected at registration time.

A plugin that wants to **act** on the capability should register a
transformer/emitter (for viewer behaviour) or check
`resolved.is_active("acme.custom_taxonomy")` in its own code.

Runtime third-party plugin loading is wired through the
`okf_loom.viewer_plugins` entry-point group; plugins run in
registration order behind the two-layer active-code gate (see
[config_yaml.md § viewer.allow_active_code](config_yaml.md) and
[`/reference/architecture.md`](/reference/architecture.md)).

# Capability id rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Namespace | Built-ins start with `okf.cap.`. User-defined must contain a `.` (e.g. `acme.x`). |
| Stability | Ids are stable across releases; removal is a breaking change. |
| Versioning | Each `Capability` carries `min_spec_version` (default `0.1`). |
