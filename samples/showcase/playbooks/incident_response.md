# Severity

Match the customer's SLA tier from [SLA tiers](/references/sla_tiers.md)
to decide response time.

# Steps

1. **Acknowledge** the page within the SLA window.
2. **Open the bridge.** Use the on-call Zoom link.
3. **Identify the blast radius.** Which
   [services](/services/checkout.md) and
   [tables](/tables/orders.md) are affected?
4. **Mitigate.** Roll back, scale out, or shed load.
5. **Resolve.** Confirm green on the dashboard.
6. **Postmortem.** File within 48h; link the ADR if architectural
   (e.g. [event sourcing](/decisions/adopt_event_sourcing.md)).

# Common failures

* **Checkout 5xx:** usually Stripe timeouts; see
  [checkout](/services/checkout.md).
* **Billing lag:** see [billing](/services/billing.md).
