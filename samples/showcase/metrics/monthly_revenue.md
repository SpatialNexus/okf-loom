# Definition

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', placed_at) AS month,
  SUM(gross_amount_usd) - SUM(refund_amount_usd) AS net_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('placed', 'fulfilled', 'refunded')
GROUP BY 1
```

# Inputs

* [orders](/tables/orders.md): gross amounts.
* [customers](/tables/customers.md): tier enrichment.
* [subscriptions](/datasets/subscriptions.md): MRR component.

# Caveats

Refund timing follows the [refund flow](/playbooks/refund_flow.md); a
refund in month N can reduce month N-0 revenue if back-dated.
